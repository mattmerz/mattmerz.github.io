            <p><img src="berk.png" class="tide"><a href=https://www.berkshirehathaway.com>Berkshire Hathaway</a>... Berkshire Hathaway... where do I start. Yes you're website works. Is it clean? Sure, kitchen cabinets from the 1960s can be clean, doesn't mean they aren't not outdated. I understand you are going for the "our website should look and give off the same energy as our company" vibe but come on. This website is older then Warren Buffett. Okay the jokes are done. The website is very a simple HTML site that uses tables and unordered lists. The way Berkshire Hathaway acheives this list is very weird in my opinion. They use a table to put two list items side by side which I believe could have been done better. The page is updated regularly with the last update being yesterday. The color scheme is <i>classic</i>, using the same color as their logo for all text on the page. The website does work on a phone and different browsers. One thing I like about the website is that I learned Berkshire Hathaway has activewear! I would say its clothing is designed by the same guy who does their website... I hope thats enough said. The old geico add in the footer wraps it up with a beautiful bow. </p>
