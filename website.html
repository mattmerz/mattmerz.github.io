            <p><img src="espn.png" class="tide"><a href=http://www.espn.com>ESPN</a> is the gold standard when it comes to sports websites. With its signature navigation tab that has great webpages to its beautiful color pallet, ESPN stands above. Looking at the code you can see not a lot of simple HTML. They use tons of Div elements as well as scripts and iFrames. The webpage works well on all browsers including mobile phones. I don't appreciate the new emphasis on ESPN+ but that's besides the point. A feature I'm a huge fan of is that ESPN changes the order of its navigation tab at the top based on what you look at the most. Ths would be a really cool thing to learn how to do. It's also impressive how they have so many webpages available and I've never experienced any type of error or mislinking. As I mentioned previously ESPN color and logo choices are top tier. Its main logo is crafted beautifully as its edges fit perfectly inside the header. The layout makes perfect sense because it is cronological. At the top of the HTML is anything pertaining to the header or top navigation, as you move further down on the code you can find the main body of the website which has every individual article or video panel also in chronological order. Then after you can find the code for the side panels which if you are logged in displays your favorite teams and their news. Overall this website is built for the user and no short cuts are taken. Great job ESPN and Disney Web Developers. </p>
