            <li>Background or header images are cool and enticing to viewers</li>

            <header>Head Bang against the wall bad :o</header>

            <li>The footer is actually really cool and has a clean look</li>
            <li>Mountain News panel thing is kinda cool</li>

            <li>Website loads really slow, once loaded website freezes just scrolling</li>
            <li>Background photo is a lot to process, wish it was just white</li>
            <li>Footer is too big for the information present, would shrink all items in the footer as well as the footer size in general</li>
